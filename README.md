# Wallpaper-Change
This is a simple python project(program) to download and set desktop wallpaper automatically.
It is for windows operating system.So, for mac or Linux you have to change the command for downloading an image using image url.
The source from which images are downloaded is 'Unsplah'.
It is needed an Unsplash access key to get random image. And set the access key for the variable 'access_key'. (in this source code it is already set as an Environment variable)
Set the 'absolute_path' variable as the absolute path to the folder to which the image is downloaded.
